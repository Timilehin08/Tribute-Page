    <h3 id="headline">Here's a little about Evang. Ravi's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1946</strong> - </li>
      <li>Born in Madras, India. His family moved to Delhi when he was quite young and he grew up there. His family was Anglican, but he was a "skeptic" until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While he was in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14, which contains Jesus' words to Thomas. Zacharias said it was John 14:19 that touched him as the defining paradigm, "Because I live, you also will live," and that he thought, "This may be my only hope: A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life." He committed his life to Christ, praying that "Jesus if You are the one who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. Please get me out of this hospital bed well, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth.
        <li>

        <strong>1972</strong> - On 7 May 1972, Zacharias married Margaret "Margie" Reynolds, whom he met at his church's youth group.They had three children, Sarah, Nathan and Naomi. He lived in Atlanta, Georgia. He also Earned his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College (now Tyndale University) this same year.

      <li>
        <strong>2004</strong> - Zacharias attracted media attention. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) opened its signature pulpit at the Salt Lake Tabernacle to him for a series of messages. Zacharias delivered a sermon on "Who Is the Truth? Defending Jesus Christ as The Way, The Truth and The Life" to some 7,000 lay-persons and scholars from both LDS and Protestant camps in an initiatory move towards open dialogue between the camps.Some evangelicals criticized Zacharias' decision not to use this opportunity to directly address the "deep and foundational" differences between the historic Christian faith and that of the teachings of the LDS Church. He responded by asserting that Christians should not immediately condemn Mormonism's theological differences but "graciously build one step at a time in communicating our faith with clarity and conviction". He said this is just as effective as showing someone the faults of their faith. The speaking engagement was nearly sabotaged by a claim by event organizer Greg Johnson, president of Standing Together, that Zacharias had nothing to do with editing the book The Kingdom of the Cults and had only loaned his name to the latest edition. Johnson later apologized for his comment.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2017</strong> - In 2017, Christianity Today reported accusations that Zacharias had exaggerated his academic credentials; for instance that he had referred to himself in multiple articles and videos with the title "Doctor" or "Dr.", despite lacking a PhD qualification. In response, Zacharias claimed to have been "conferred ten honorary doctorates" and claimed further that "in Ravi’s homeland of India… honorific titles are customary and are used frequently out of respect for elders, including by the RZIM India team when addressing Ravi." The veracity of Zacharias's purported academic positions at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge was also questioned.

In a statement, RZIM indicated that "[in] earlier years, 'Dr.' did appear before Ravi's name in some of our materials, including on our website, which is an appropriate and acceptable practice with honorary doctorates. However, because this practice can be contentious in certain circles, we no longer use it." Christianity Today reported that Zacharias' online biography was edited following the accusations regarding his credentials.

Canadian ministry supporter Lori Anne Thompson accused Zacharias of impropriety involving sexting and exchanging inappropriate emails with her. Christianity Today magazine reported that Zacharias filed a RICO suit against Thompson in response to a demand letter containing explicit allegations against Zacharias. The case was settled in November 2017. In a 3 December 2017 statement, Zacharias said, "Let me state categorically that I never met [Thompson] alone, publicly or privately. The question is not whether I solicited or sent any illicit photos or messages to [her]—I did not, and there is no evidence to the contrary—but rather, whether I should have been a willing participant in any extended communication with a woman not my wife. The answer, I can unequivocally say, is no, and I fully accept responsibility." Zacharias added that he had been "absolutely faithful" to his wife Margie throughout their marriage, but acknowledged that he "failed to exercise wise caution and to protect [himself] from even the appearance of impropriety….Zacharias declined to comment on the alleged suicide threat he made to Thompson, citing the terms of his non-disclosure agreement with Thompson.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2020</strong> - In March 2020, Zacharias was diagnosed with a malignant and rare cancer within his spine, and on 19 May 2020 he died at his home in Atlanta at the age of 74. Following his death, a a number of high-profile Christians posted messages online detailing Zacharias's influence upon them.

        "Evang Ravi's life and achievement is  testimony to God's redemptive power. “It was his Savior, Jesus Christ, that my dad always wanted most to talk about. Even in his final days, until he lacked the energy and breath to speak, he turned every conversation to Jesus and what the Lord had done. He perpetually marveled that God took a seventeen-year-old skeptic, defeated in hopelessness and unbelief, and called him into a life of glorious hope and belief in the truth of Scripture—a message he would carry across the globe for 48 years… Today my beautiful father is more alive than he has even been. We thank God for him and recommit our lives to sharing this truth with all who will hear, until He calls us to our eternal home.”"
